According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a "state-sponsored actor"[6] and claims that such "intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry".[7] While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.[2][19]
U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the Russian government.[2] According to The Wall Street Journal at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.[20]
Security adviser at cyber security firm F-Secure Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that "there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while "China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information" and "has a voracious appetite for personal information".[21] Examples of state-sponsored data breaches targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are the massive data breach[22] of 18 million people from the United States Office of Personnel Management and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed Operation Aurora.[21]
Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a cybercriminal group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.[19] Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from Comodo notes that "Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection".[19]
According to an interview by WIRED via encrypted, anonymous IM with the person selling the accounts on the dark web, "Peace_of_mind", the hack was done by a "'team' of Russians".[13]
On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now "Peace_of_mind" responds:
Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.
And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:
It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.
And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:
Well, [the] main use is for spamming. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of Netflix, Paypal, Amazon, etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)
